  #Have you wonder what is the order to use handle_cast/info/call?
  #handle_info: Just for manage system messages: Ex - To notify monitors that something happend
  #handle_cast: Do not provide an specific answer. It always answers ok bc yes, or bc nope but you don't know what really happend
  #handle_call: When you always expect an answer - The predilected one bc it can also handle :noreply - we don't have/still not an answer

  #With the previous concepts clear, now let's talk about the tuples that these functions returns
  #Things can be more than :reply or :noreply

  #GenServer provides some atoms to say that something went wrong
  #Let's check init - In normal conditions it always returns :ok, but not the only one

    #{:ok, %{count: 0}}
    {:ok, %{count: 0}, 1500}# - You can also manipulate how much are you waiting to finished inside the function and handle that 'log' using  a handle_info. Not matching with [timeout: xxxx]
    #{:stop, "Something needed it still not ready..."} #If the start is linked, it will fail and restart the iex
    #:ignore - Well, the atom is pretty intuitive: If something goes fine or not, it still going
