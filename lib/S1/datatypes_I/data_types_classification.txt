-pid: represets a process identifier

Structures:
-Tuple: a collection of elements with a fixed size and order (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
-List: a collection of elements with a variable size and order (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
-Map: a collection of key-value pairs (e.g., %{name: "Alice", age: 30}).
-String: Sequence of bytes, not as a linked list of characters like in some other languages
-Struct: a map with a predefined set of keys and default values (e.g., defstruct name: "Alice", age: 30).
