  The pin operator (^) in Elixir is used to pattern match against a value that has already been assigned to a variable, rather than rebinding the variable to a new value.
  
  The pin operator is necessary in cases where you want to pattern match against a specific value that is already bound to a variable, rather than pattern matching against
  any value that might be bound to that variable.

  _ = """
  A wildcard character and is often used as a placeholder for variables whose values are not needed.
  It can be used to ignore certain variables or to match any value.

      # To prevent rebinding and match against the existing value of x, you can use the pin operator. In this code, the ^x pattern matches against the existing value of x (which is 10), so the code will print "No match".
